# Saving the Tinosaur Board Internal Battery
You connect the Tinosaur board to a computer using a USBasp cable. Before connecting the board to the computer, make sure to remove the internal battery from the battery holder. The USBasp cable supplies power to the board, and if you leave the battery connected, the battery overcharges.

Removing a shield (LED Shield) does not mean that the program has stopped running. To stop a running program:
- Disconnect the cable from the USB programmer and remove the internal battery
- Remove the battery jumper to disconnect the power from the battery or plug the jumper component on only one of the leads of the 2x1 male header

## Powering the Board with a Battery
The only time you need to use the internal battery is when you want to run a program and the board is not connected to a computer.
