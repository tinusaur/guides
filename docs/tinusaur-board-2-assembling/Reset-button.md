Cut the lower part of the leads if they are too thick to go through the printed circuit board (PCB) holes.

To insert the Reset button into the PCB:

1. Insert the reset button into the SW1 holes of the PCB. Make sure the reset button is facing out.
2. Bend the leads slightly in opposing directions to ensure the button fits tightly on the PCB.
3. Solder the reset button on the front side of the PCB.
