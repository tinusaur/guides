Does orientation matter: Yes

Check the 2 springs of the battery holder and make sure they are pressed down.

To mount the battery holder:

1. Flip the printed circuit board (PCB) upside down.
2. Sand the solders to make them equal in h–µight.
3. Orient the battery holder as shown in the photos and insert the leads in place.
4. Solder the leads on the front side of the PCB. Put more solder wire than usual.


**Caution**: This solder is the most challenging one. Be very careful not to touch the elecrolytic capacitor with the soldering iron.
