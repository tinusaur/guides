# Checking Your Solders

Before you solder the battery socket onto your printed circuit board (PCB), make sure you have correctly connected the other components to the PCB.

Check for the following defects:
### Short Circuits:
* **Description:**
	Two or more solders are joined together. Two or more leads touching can also cause a short circuit.
*  **Resolution:**
	Use a soldering iron to reheat the space between the two joints. Drag tweezers or a sharp object between the solders to separate the joints.
    
### Cold Joints:
* **Description:**
	Joints that have too little or too much solder.
* **Resolution:**
	* When not enough solder, use a soldering iron to reheat the joint and to add more soldering wire.
	* When too much solder, use a soldering iron to heat the joint and a desoldering vacuum pump to remove the defective solder. Then, you can resolder the joint.
