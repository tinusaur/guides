Does orientation matter: **Yes**

Check the spring of the battery holder and make sure it fits in the holder properly.

To mount the battery holder:

1. Flip the PCB upside down.
2. Sand the solders to make them equal in hеight.
3. Orient the battery holder as shown in the photos and insert the leads in place.
4. Solder the leads on the front side of the PCB. Put more solder wire than usual.


**Caution**: This solder is the most challenging one. Be very careful not to touch the elecrolytic capacitor with the soldering iron.
