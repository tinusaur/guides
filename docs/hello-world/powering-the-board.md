# Powering the Tinosaur Board
You connect the Tinosaur board to a computer using a USBasp cable. Before connecting the board to the computer, make sure to remove the battery from the battery holder. The USBasp cable supplies power to the board, and if you leave the battery connected, the battery overcharges. 

**WARNING:** Overcharging the battery is dangerous. 

## Powering the Board with a Battery
The only time you need to use the battery is when you want to run a program when the board is not connected to a computer. 

When not using the board, switch off the power supply by removing the battery or by connecting the jumper component to only one of the leads of the 2x1 male header. Removing a shield (LED Shield) does not mean that the program has stopped running.
