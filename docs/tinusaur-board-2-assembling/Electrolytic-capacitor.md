# Electrolytic Capacitor

Does orientation matter: Yes

1. Insert the leads of the electrolytic capacitor into the C1 plus and minus holes on the printed circuit board (PCB) front side.

**Note:** The negative lead of the electrolytic capacitor is marked with a white line on the cylinder, and is the shorter of the two pins of the electrolytic capacitor.

2. Pull the leads down so that the electrolytic capacitor fits tightly on the PCB front side. 
3. Bend the leads slightly in opposing directions to prevent the resistor from falling off the PCB.
4. Turn the PCB on its backside.
5. Solder the leads of the electrolytic capacitor to the PCB backside. 
6. Cut the leads to length.
