# Before you begin



Assimbling the Tinosaur board is a task that usually takes about an hour and a half to perform. 



To ensure the assembly runs smooth and trouble-free, prepare in advance.



## The Tools

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following tools at hand.

* Soldering kit 

* Solder wire

* Sandpaper

* Shearcutter (nail clippers can also do the job)




## Tips and Tricks

* The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) usually has one or more tabs that are sticking out. Remove the tabs  with a shearcutter and sand the sides of the PCB.

* Always follow the instructions for positioning the components on the PCB. Some components have specific orientation and it is important that you observe the positioning rules.

* The melted solder wire dries very quickly. Do not try to blow it dry after you are done soldering a component.
