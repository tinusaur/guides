Cut the lower part of the leads if it is too thick to go through the PCB holes.

To insert the Reset button into the PCB:

1. Insert the reset button into the SW1 holes of the PCB. Make sure the reset button is facing out.
2. Bend the leads slightly in opposing directions to ensure the button fits tightly on the PCB.
3. Solder the reset button on the front side of the PBC.
