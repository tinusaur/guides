# Soldering for Beginners 
## What is Soldering?
Soldering is a method of joining components permanently to a printed circuit board (PCB). You use an alloy of tin and lead called solder to bind a component lead to the copper path of a circuit.

## Soldering Tools
### Main Tools
The two soldering tools you need to get started are __soldering iron__ and __solder wire__.

### Additional Tools
+ Wire cutter: use to cut extra wire and pins/leads. If you do not have a wire cutter or you do not want to buy one, you can use a nail clipper.
+ Solder pump and solder wick: you use these to undo a soldering mistake or remove a bad solder.
+ Tweezers: use tweezers to hold small components and avoid burning your fingers while soldering. 
+ Wet sponge: use it to clean the tip of the soldering iron.
+ Safety glasses
+ Solder fume extractor
