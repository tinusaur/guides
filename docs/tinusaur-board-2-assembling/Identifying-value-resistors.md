# Identifying the Value of a Resistor

A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. Resistors can also be used to provide a specific voltage for an active device, for example an LED (light-emitting diode). The Tinosaur kit might contain more than one resistor, each having a different purpose.

To identify the value of a resistor (measured in ohms), use the following color-coded table:

Using this color scheme, you can determine the value of the resistors in the Tinosaur kit. After identifying the resistors based on their value, you can consult the printed circuit board (PBC) scheme to place the resistors in the correct location.

Example
-------
Using the numbers and colors of the resistor bands, you determine the value of the resistor. The following resistor is a 10000 ohm (10k) resistor:

The value is calculated as follows:
* The first band is brown, which represents 1
* The second band is black, which represents 0
* The third band is orange, which represents the number of zeros at the end - in this case 3
The total value of the capacitor is 10 000 ohms.
* The golden band represents the tolerance of the capacitor value.
